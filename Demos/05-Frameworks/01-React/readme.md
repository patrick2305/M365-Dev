[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Install React CLI

```
npm i -g create-react-app
create-react-app [Project Name] --scripts-version 2.0.3 [--typescript]
```

> Note: Yeoman Genarator for SPFx generates classes instead of functions. We recommend following this pattern until you have a basic understanding on how things work together.
